# Pagination

## Overview

## Usage

A pagination can be used in the following cases:

- Search results pages

## Anatomy

1. Previous and next buttons
2. Page number
3. Ellipsis

## Best practices

Each page should be accessible by a unique URL.

Visually distinguish the current page from the other pages.

Should I also place pagination on top of a page?
Should I keep visible the previous button when I'm on the first page?
