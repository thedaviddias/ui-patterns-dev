## Anatomy

## Best practices

Do not show a breadcrumb if the navigation’s hierarchy contains only one level

A breadcrumb is not necessary if the user is already at the top level of the hierarchy.

✅ Place the breadcrumb at the top of the page, below the global navigation and above the page title

✅ The title of the current page can be dropped if breadcrumbs are above the page title

✅ The breadcrumb should be left-aligned

❌ If last item is the current page title, it should not be clickable

- Gives the user a quick confirmation of where they are in the hierarchy.
- Make is obvious that the last item is not clickable (through color, cursor type, etc.)

Can I replace the home by an icon?
