- When the user needs to write a short text with not particular formating

4. Helper text
5. Validation message

## Best practices

Place short and concise labels above the input field and align to the left

## Accessibility

## Checklists

### Design

- [ ] Don't rely **only on color to indicate the state of the text field**. Use a different border color or a different icon to indicate the state of the text field.
- [ ] Avoid using an icon signifiying an **error state inside a text field**. It's easier to establish a common pattern for all input fields. For example: inputs `type=file` don't contain text, it's usually represented by a button. A password field has usually an eye icon on the right of the input. A date field has usually a calendar icon on the right of the input. A search field has usually a clear icon on the right of the input.

### Development

- [ ] Use the correct input type depending on the data you are asking for. For example, use `type="email"` for email addresses or `type="tel"` for phone numbers.
