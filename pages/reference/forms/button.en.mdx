# Button

## Overview

The user needs to confirm an action or trigger an event.

## Usage

A button can be used in the following cases:

- To trigger an action or event
- To submit a form
- To open or close a dialog

They are usually used in forms, [dialogs](), [cards](), and [toolbars]().

## Types

### Primary button

The primary button is used to trigger the main action of a page or screen.

### Secondary button

The secondary button is used to trigger secondary actions.

### Tertiary button

The tertiary button is used to trigger tertiary actions.

## Anatomy

1. **Label**: The button label communicates the action that will occur when the user interacts with it.
2. **Icon**: Icons can be added to buttons to clarify an action. Icons should be the same color as the text and should be placed on the left side of the label.
3. **Loading**: A loading indicator should be used when the button action triggers a loading state.

## Best practices

❌ No have more than one primary action button on the screen at a time

✅ Use the same button style for the same action throughout the app

#### Size

✅ Make buttons finger-friendly for mobile users

"
  width="100%"
  height="500px"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

Some websites use common [dark pattern](https://www.deceptive.design/) when they don't want users to take a certain action (to cancel your subscription, for example).

#### Placement

✅ The primary action button should be placed at the bottom right

Full page designs should have the primary button on the left side of the page
